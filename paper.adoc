== Introduction

The popularity of the Rust programming language is rising, and it is one of the most admired programming languages <<Sta16>> <<Sta20>> <<Sta23>> <<Bug22>>. It integrates modern tooling like standardized dependency management, testing, documentation generation, formatting, and building. In the future, adoption will probably increase further, and it could replace {cpp} as the most common systems programming language <<Bug22>>.
Rust also provides benefits in domains other than systems programming. It has been shown that Rust can be used for other fields such as GPU programming, web development, or logic programming <<Sah22>> <<Byc22>> <<Kyr22>>. These fields profit from some of the benefits of Rust, like guaranteed memory safety and improved productivity  <<Bug22>> <<Cos19>>.

This paper explores how Rust can be used in FPGA firmware development. Usually, FPGA firmware is developed in a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL. In these languages, the programmer has to describe the hardware in detail. This low-level approach can lead to efficient designs but is quite time-consuming <<Mil20>>. The RustHDL project facilitates expressing hardware descriptions in Rust similar to traditional HDLs <<Smi21>>. In addition to manually designing hardware in an HDL, it is also possible to use high-level synthesis (HLS) to generate hardware descriptions in HDLs from an algorithmic description written in high-level programming languages. Typically systems programming languages are used for writing these specifications. This increases productivity at the cost of slightly less optimized designs <<Mil20>>. There are multiple HLS tools available that can synthesize HDL descriptions from {cpp} code. Some of these tools are based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure <<Nan16>>. The only previous report on using Rust as an HLS language focuses on a limited subset of Rust and its formal verification <<Har22>>. 

// As Rust is also based on LLVM, it can be used with these tools too. 

// To determine the feasibility of utilizing Rust as a source language for High-Level Synthesis (HLS).
An investigation to identify HLS tools compatible with Rust was conducted. A modular approach was developed to seamlessly integrate HLS tools with RustHDL. By employing this approach, a proof-of-concept integration with the PandA Bambu HLS framework was achieved, demonstrating the feasibility of using Rust as a source language for HLS. The performance of designs generated from various algorithms was compared with that of designs generated from algorithmically equivalent {cpp} code. The evaluation showed that, in most cases, the Rust-based workflow produced designs with similar characteristics to those derived from {cpp}-based workflows.

=== vega-lite

Vega-lite is the preferred way to display any data-driven charts. You use the included `vega-chart.adoc` script to include vega-lite charts. It detects if the document is currently built for a browser or as a PDF. If the document is built for a browser, it will include the chart directly via the vega javascript library. That way the chart supports tooltips and other interactive features.

== Using source listings

Asciidoc also supports source listings. A short verilog listing is shown in <<short-verilog-listing>>.

.Short Verilog listing
[source#short-verilog-listing,verilog]
----
module Blinker (input clock, output blinker);
  reg [6:0] counter = 0;
  reg state = 0;
  always @(posedge clock) begin
    counter <= counter + 1;
    if (counter == 9) begin
      state   <= ~state;
      counter <= 0;
    end
  end
  assign blinker = state;
endmodule
----

<<long-rust-listing>> shows a long Rust listing. This template has a `.linenums` class that can be added to code listings to enable line numbers. The normal asciidoc `linenums` attribute is not supported.

.Long rust listing with line numbers
[source#long-rust-listing.linenums,rust]
----
include::assets/long_rust_listing.rs[tag=function]
----

Your code should be not wider than 80 characters. If it is try using the `oversized` classes to avoid unnecessary line breaks.


== Future work


// How can the Rust compiler be made to generate better LLVM IR for HLS?

// Measure more test cases

// Test out the limitations of the toolchain

// 



// Can it be better than CPP when the tools are adjusted for Rust LLVM?
Future work on HLS from Rust should focus on improving support for Rust-generated LLVM IR in HLS tools. While Bambu can currently synthesize the LLVM IR generated by Rust, it seems possible to improve the generated designs in some cases. Finding these cases and improving Bambu to handle them should be possible.

It would also be interesting to see if the LLVM IR generated by Rust can be improved to generate better designs. Our toolchain builds every project dependency separately and then links them together. This is not ideal, as it does not allow the compiler to perform cross-crate link-time optimizations. This would probably require adjusting cargo or the Rust compiler to allow link-time optimizations when compiling to LLVM IR. The toolchain only configures the Rust compiler with the settings necessary for generating LLVM IR that Bambu can synthesize. Besides that, it uses rustc's default optimization profiles for speed and size. There are probably significant improvements possible by evaluating which optimizations are useful for HLS and which are not.

// Bambu provides a research environment to experiment with new ideas across HLS, high-level verification, and debugging.
// Bambu input: standard C/{cpp} specifications, LLVM IR, IRs from GCC
// Includes many optimizations
// Makes it easy to integrate new transformations and optimizations
// Is open-source
// Bambu is a command line tool
// Supports most C/{cpp} constructs
// Bambu has three phases. frontend, middleend and backend
// Frontend: Uses Clang or gcc
// Uses a compiler plugin for both extracting the call graph and control flow information
// Builds its own static single assignment IR
// This decouples the compiler front end from the rest of the HLS process.
// Vivado HLS has a frontend based on Clang
// Middle end:
// Bambu rebuilds the call graph and control data flow graph and adds its own data structures.
// Applies a set of analyses and transformations.
// Including common software compilation optimizations
// Including target-specific transformations. Such as replacing multiplication and divisions with constants with shift and add operations.
// Can exploit custom-sized operators
// TODO: Explore if Bambu can use the rust crate for more integer sizes like u21
// Bambu performs bitwidth and range analysis to minimize bit width
// Backend: Bambu performs the actual architectural synthesis here
// The synthesis process acts on every function individually
// Every function has at least two parts: control logic and datapath
// Control logic is an FSM
// Control logic handles the routing of data values and temporal execution of ops
// Bambu steps:
// * Function allocation
// Bambu has a technology library for standard system libraries such as libm or libs
// This step associates High-level functions with hardware resources
// Bambu supports sharing functions across module boundaries
// * Memory allocation
// Defines memories to store variables.
// Defines how dynamic memory is implemented
// Memories in Bambu can be classified as read-only, local, with aligned or unaligned memory access
// Bambu supports accessing protocol-based memories
// * Resource allocation
// Maps operations (not mapped onto functions) onto resource units
// Resource units are available in the Bambu's resource library
// Floating point operations are supported by generating soft floating point cores
// Rich resource library with multiple implementations for the same operation
// Resource library annotated with latency and resource occupation.
// * Scheduling
// Bambu uses List scheduling
// Every operation has a priority
// An operation is ready when its dependencies have been satisfied
// Ready operations can be scheduled if the resources are available
// Multiple competing for a resource: higher priority
// Also has a speculative scheduling algo
// * binding
// Pretty much standard
// Bambu considers how profitable it is for two operations to share the same resource
// Resources that occupy a big area are more likely to be shared
// * netlist generation
// Translates the architecture in an RTL description
// In Verilog or VHDL
//
// Research topics for Bambu: "They range from parallelized hardware accelerator design, dynamic scheduling, verification, and debugging, design exploration of the compilation flow, machine learning accelerator design, IR development, and integration with logic synthesis tools", MLIR
// MLIR dialects that can be translated to LLVM IR

// Survey literature from 2010 to 2016
// Probably the best comparison of HLS and RTL
// Also, the newest
// Shows that the quality of results of RTL is better than that of HLS
// Shows that development time with HLS is a third of that of the RTL flow
// Shows that the productivity of a designer is over four times higher with HLS than with RTL
// Vivado HLS is the most common HLS tool. At least it is used significantly more than any other HLS tool in papers.
// Xilinx is the leading FPGA vendor
// FPGAs are made of configurable logic blocks (CLB, different vendors, different names).
// The CLBs are connected with programmable interconnects.
// The CLBs consist of a few logic cells, logic elements, or adaptive logic modules (ALM) (LC, LE, and ALM are the same. Different vendors use different names).
// Logic cells are made of a combination of programmable look-up tables (LUTs) and flip-flops (FFs).
// FPGAs can also have other resources, but these are vendor specific. Most commonly, DSP blocks and BRAM blocks.
// There are four performance metrics that are commonly used to compare HLS and RTL: performance, execution time, latency, maximum frequency
// For projects bigger than 250 lines of code HLS also needs fewer lines of code than RTL
// Reduction in development time for HLS seems independent of project size.
// On average, HLS uses 41% more basic FPGA resources than RTL
// The usage of advanced FPGA resources of HLS is similar to RTL
// C-based languages are the most common, then OpenCL-based, then high-level language based.
// CUDA/OpenCL-based HLS is especially resource-consuming and has the worst performance
// The performance of HLS designs is similar to the performance of RTL designs.
// The only example in academia where the development time of HLS was more than RTL was when the developer had to learn the HLS tool in the process.
// Only looks at small to medium designs, 50-500 lines of code
// It is easier to adopt HLS than RTL for people who have experience in software design
// HLS allows for efficient behavioral verification
// The HLS output must still be verified for non-behavioral aspects. This traditional verification is difficult because there is no direct relationship to the source code.
// HLS halves verification time in many cases
// HLS is a particularly good choice when the time to market is a dominant issue, and there is no compelling need to gain the ultimate performance or smallest resource usage for the product
// There is no standard example to compare HLS and RTL

// "adoption of FPGAs in many application domains including wireless communications, embedded signal processing, networking, ASIC prototyping, high-frequency trading, and many more."
// Deployed on a large scale in data centers, packet processing, machine learning
// Lower efficiency than ASICs
// FPGA, on average 35 times larger than ASIC implementation
// FPGA, on average four times slower than ASIC implementation
// For designs that utilize other FPGA blocks, the gap is smaller, still nine times large
// FPGA architects seek to reduce the gap while maintaining programmability
// Early FPGAs were simple arrays of logic blocks
// Modern FPGAs are complex heterogeneous architectures that have more block types
// Modern FPGA have blocks like BRAM, DSP, processors, external interfaces
// FPGA architectures are evaluated based on the efficiency of implementing a wide variety of designs
// There are academic test suites for evaluating FPGA architectures
// VTR is a CAD system to layout designs on FPGAs
// CAD system applies a series of complex optimizations 
// CAD system converts RTL design to netlist.
// CAD system maps netlist to FPGA blocks
// CAD system places blocks on FPGA and routes the connections between them

// "Total area is the sum of the areas of the FPGA blocks used by the application, along with the programmable routing included with them."
// Timing analyzer finds the critical path through blocks and routing
// Critical path limits maximum clock frequency
// Power consumption is estimated based on resources used and signal toggle rate
// _hardened_ blocks are blocks that are implemented as ASICs
// What functionality to harden is a design choice
// What area of the FPGA to use for hardened blocks is a design choice
// Hardened blocks can still have some level of configurability
// How flexible the hardened blocks are is a design choice
// Hardened blocks are faster, smaller and more power efficient than programmable blocks
// Tradeoff between flexibility and efficiency
// Unused hardened blocks are wasted silicon
// Problems with slow routing to hardened blocks, if they are far away
// PAL first reconfigurable computing devices
// PAL does not scale well; area increases quadratically with IO size
// CPLD includes multiple PALs and programmable routing in a package
// 1984 Xilinx pioneers first LUT-based FPGA
// SRAM-based LUTs with interconnects between them
// Scales well
// Much higher area efficiency than and/or based designs
// LUTs form the fundamental logic element in all commercial FPGAs
// Alternative designs perform worse than LUTs
// K-LUT implements a K-input LUT
// K-LUT stores the truth table in SRAM cells,
// K input signals are used as multiplexers to select line
// truth table contains 2^K values
// A basic logic element (BLE) is a K-LUT with an output register
// A BLE can implement DFF or a K-LUT
// A BLE has K inputs and two outputs, one for routing and one for feedback inside the LE
// Logic blocks are composed of multiple (N) BLEs
// Logic blocks have a local interconnect
// The local interconnect connects the inputs of the LB and the feedback outputs of the BLEs to the inputs of the BLEs.
// The local interconnect is often arranged as a local full or partial crossbar.
// See Figure 4 in the paper.
// Over time, K and N have increased.
// More K means more functionality in a single LUT
// More K leads to less logic in the critical path
// More N means less demand for fast inter-LB routing
// The area of the LUT increases exponentially with K as more SRAM cells are needed (2^K)
// More K linearly degrades the speed of the LUT
// If the local interconnect is a crossbar, its size increases quadratically with N
// If the local interconnect is a crossbar, its size decreases linearly with N
// Empirically, the best size for K is 4-6, and for N, it is 3-10
// First LUT-based FPGA from Xilinx: N = 2, K = 3
// Around 2000: 4-LUTs common
// Study: 4-LUTs vs 6-LUTS: 6-LUTS:14% more perf, 17% bigger
// Fracturable LUTs can be broken down into smaller LUTs, but limitations like shared inputs
// FPGA architectures from Xilinx and Altera converge to relatively large LBs with 8 and 10 N
// Future designs even bigger LBs
// inter-LB wire delay scales poorly with a process shrink
// Larger LB sizes can lead to faster CAD tool runtimes
// Modern FPGAs have more than 1 FFs per BLE
// Even though there are optimization, the core ideas stayed similar
// 22% of logic elements in FPGAs are implementing arithmetic
// These operations can be implemented with LUTs but are inefficient
// A ripple carry adder requires 2 * the number of bits LUTs
// This leads to high logic utilization and long critical paths
// All modern FPGAs include hardened arithmetic circuitry in their logic blocks
// How the arithmetic is accelerated is a design choice
// It can be a dedicated adder between two LUTs
// It can be just a fast path for the carry bit
// At least 3x faster than LUT-based implementations
// NOTE: there is more detail on the different types of arithmetic optimizations in the paper
// Recently, deep learning has become a key workload
// Deep learning has multiply-accumulate operations at its core, which could benefit from hardened, bigger hardened arithmetic
// Programmable routing is over 50% of the area of an FPGA
// Programmable routing accounts for over half the critical path delay
// High multiplier density in signal processing and communication applications
// Main design philosophy of the DSP block is to minimize the number of soft logic used to implement common DSP algorithms
// FPGA CAD tools will automatically map multiplication to DSP blocks
// Bigger FPGA designs always require a memory buffer
// Making soft memory out of LUTs is over 100x less dense than SRAM cells
// Modern FPGAs are about 25% BRAM

// Intro of first languages with a system-level abstraction like SystemC or SystemVerilog
// 2000s transaction-level modeling
// ESL paradigm shift caused by rising system complexities
// HLS reduced time for creating hardware
// HLS reduced time for verification
// HLS enables the reuse of the same specification for different targets (ASICs, FPGAs, different ASICS, and FPGAs)
// functional specification = untimed high level description
// NOTE: contains more info about HLS design flow
// HLS tools transform an untimed specification into a fully timed implementation
// HLS tools generate custom architecture to efficiently implement the specification
// HLS tools generate an RTL implementation
// DIAGRAM: High-level synthesis design steps
// Generated architecture (usually) consists of a datapath and a controller.
// Generated architecture also has memory banks and communications interfaces.
// HLS tools usually perform seven tasks:
// 1. Compiling the specification
// 2. Allocating/Creating hardware resources
// 3. Scheduling operations to clock cycles
// 4. Binding operations to functional units
// 5. Binding variables to storage elements
// 6. Binding transfers to connection units
// 7. Generating the RTL architecture
// Steps 2-6 are called interdependent
// Compiling transforms the specification into a formal description
// Compiling performs optimizations
// Formal model classically exhibits data and control dependencies.
// Data flow graph: Every operation is a node, and the edges are values (input, temporary, and output)
// A pure data flow graph (DFG) models data flow only
// In some cases, a pure DFG can be created. Can be done by completely unrolling loops and multiplexing conditional assignments.
// Pure DFG is big and impractical
// Cannot support unbounded iteration and nonstatic control flow (like goto)
// control and data flow graph (CDFG) models data and control flow
// CDFG nodes are called basic blocks and are a straight sequence of statements
// CDFG edges can be conditional and represent if or switch constructs.
// CDFGs are more expressive because they can represent loops with unbounded iteration (those that cannot be unrolled)
// Allocation defines the types and number of resources that are needed to satisfy the design constraints
// Resources are functional units, storage elements, and communication interfaces
// HLS tools have an RTL component library with basic resources.
// Scheduling determines which operations run in which clock cycle.
// All operations must be scheduled into cycles
// If there are no data dependencies between operations, they can be scheduled in parallel
// Every variable that carries values over multiple cycles must be bound to a storage element
// Variables with nonoverlapping lifetimes can be bound to the same storage element
// Every operation must be bound to a functional unit that can perform the operation
// Every connection between functional units and storage elements must be bound to a connection unit
// After allocation, scheduling, and binding, the RTL architecture can be generated and output
// The architecture classically includes a controller and a datapath
// Storage elements: registers, memories, etc.
// functional units: ALUs, multipliers, DSPs, and other custom functions, etc.
// connection units: buses, tristate drivers, multiplexers, etc.
// The datapath consists of the storage elements, functional units, and connection units
// All these components can be connected arbitrarily through buses
// They can also be pipelined
// The controller is a finite state machine (FSM)
// The controller orchestrates the datapath by setting values of control signals of the datapath
// The inputs of the controller can come from primary inputs or from the datapath
// The controller consists of three parts: the next state logic, a state register, and the output logic.
// The next state logic computes the next state of the FSM from the current state and the inputs.
// The state register contains the current state of the controller
// The output logic sets the control signals according to the current state
// The output logic also sets control outputs that can be used as inputs for the datapath
// The controller is usually built with hardwired logic but can be more complex with memories and such
// The controller is usually a custom processor if it is more complex.
// The state register is then called the program counter. This shows that it is just a processor.
